2. Grant of License

Prof. Suraiya Jabin of JMI hereby grants to You a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the iSignDB Dataset solely for Your non-commercial, educational, and research purposes only, but without any right to copy or reproduce, publish or otherwise make available to the public or communicate to the public, sell, rent or lend the whole or any constituent part of the iSignDB Dataset thereof. The iSignDB Dataset shall not be redistributed without the express written prior approval of the Prof. Suraiya Jabin of JMI. You agree to respect the privacy of those human subjects whose smartphone usage behavior data are included in the iSignDB Dataset. Do not attempt to reverse the anonymization process to identify specific identifiers including, without limitation, names, postal address information, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, social security numbers, and biometric identifiers. You agree not to reverse engineer, separate or otherwise tamper with the iSignDB Dataset so that data can be extracted and used outside the scope of that permitted in this Agreement. 


You agree to acknowledge the source of the iSignDB Dataset in all of Your publications and presentations based wholly or in part on the iSignDB Dataset. You agree to provide a disclaimer in any publication or presentation that the Prof. Suraiya Jabin of JMI does not bear any responsibility for Your analysis or interpretation of iSignDB Dataset.
